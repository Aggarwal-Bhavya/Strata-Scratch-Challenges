## Introduction

This repository aims to provide solutions and explanations for problems encountered on StrataScratch. Each solution is categorized by the type of problem, the associated datasets, and the corresponding approach used to solve it. The goal is to offer clear, efficient, and reproducible examples to help others learn and apply data science techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/solutions`**: Contains solution files organized by problem categories (e.g., SQL, Python, Machine Learning).
  - **`/sql`**: SQL query solutions with explanations.
  - **`/python`**: Python code solutions for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
  - **`/ml`**: Machine Learning models and techniques.
- **`/datasets`**: Contains sample datasets used in solutions.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Solutions**: Navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g., `/solutions/sql`) to find solutions for different types of problems.

2. **View Examples**: Each solution file includes code, explanations, and sometimes links to the original problem.

3. **Run Code**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Code examples may require specific libraries or environments.
